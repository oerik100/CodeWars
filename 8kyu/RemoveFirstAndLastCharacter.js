// Problem
// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

// Solution
function removeChar(str){
  str = str.slice(1);
  str = str.slice(0, str.length - 1);
  return str;
 };
